## Roadmap for This Repo
The roadmap contains a list of stuff I personally interested in.

- [x] OT Flow Matching (velocity prediction)
- [ ] Compositional Diffusion
- [ ] Score Matching
- [ ] Noise Prediction
- [ ] DPM Sampling
- [ ] DDIM Inversion
- [ ] Text-to-Image w/ CLIP & CFG

Open up an issue if you want to help out with any of these features! Accompanying blog posts can be found at [Generative and World Models @dibbla.space](https://dibbla.space/posts/learn_notes/generative_n_world_model/).
